				What's New (April 15th 2011)</h2>
			I've tried to make the site easier and more fun to use this time around.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong><a href="Trending.aspx">Trending Articles</a></strong> – You can now see
			the articles that are most often rated by other users on the trending page. If you
			are familiar with <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">
				hacker news</a> this page works very similarly. As an article is rated more
			often it will organically make its way in the top.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong><a href="RandomPage.aspx">Random Interesting Article</a></strong> – The
			whole point of this site was for me to be able to set my homepage to the random
			wikipedia article and learn about new and interesting things. If you set your homepage
			to the random page you will get a page that has been randomly selected from all
			the articles that have already been rated. <a href="RandomPage.aspx">Try it out here</a><br />
			<br />
			<strong><a href="User.aspx">Better User Page</a></strong> – Now you can see the
			articles you've already rated. No sorting or anything fancy like that (that's still
			to come), but you can see what you've rated and what you rated each article.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Bug Fixes and Usability</strong> – There have been lots of little bug fixes
			around, so hopefully you either didn't notice before or you'll notice a little more
			polish to the site. As with any (very) beta site, things are always in flux, but
			hopefully trending to the better.<br />
